# login
A React.js seed project with user management built in, designed to connect to a mySQL database

# How to use this repo:
Clone the repository, then run 'npm install' in both the root and api folders. Run both the project and the api, and you should see a page with 'login' and 'register'. A database schema is coming soon, but this project is designed to be customized for your specific application needs. The only page not included is the database connection component.
